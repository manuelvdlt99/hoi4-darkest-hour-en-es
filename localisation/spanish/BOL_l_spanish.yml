 BOL_Politics.1.t: "Military Socialist Revolution"
 BOL_Politics.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The news began to spread across the country faster than water running through a sieve, and throughout the nation, on every lip and tongue, one word was spoken over and over - revolution. What had begun as a massive labour demonstration has now expanded across the capital into a general strike, unlike anything the country has seen. The FOT and FOL, the organizations leading the strikes, submitted a series of demands to the government, the most noteworthy points being the re-importation of basic necessities, the 100% increase in wages, the reduction of rent, the prohibition of work nights, the suspension of the state of siege and guarantees for the freedom of assembly, association, press and union organization.\n\nAfter a tense few days, the newly formed Revolutionary Committee of The United Socialist Party reached an agreement with the war heroes General David Toro and Colonel Germán Busch, gaining theirs and the military's support. With this massive success, socialist militants and labour protesters surrounded and occupied the mayor's office in La Paz, and the Club de La Union, a long time gathering place for the wealthy and influential. \n\nThe next morning Colonel Busch and other officers delivered their ultimatum to President Sorzano, who promptly resigned and fled to Argentina.\n\nFor the time being, Colonel Busch has taken over as Provisional President while General Toro returns from his assignment in Chaco to assume the presidency. Busch and Toro have given statements declaring the beginning of a new military-run, socialist government."

 BOL_Politics.2.t: "Germán Busch Takes Power"
 BOL_Politics.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Over a year after the coup, yet another has taken place in La Paz. A day of protests and sporadic street violence ended today with President David Toro resigning his office, being succeeded by Colonel Germán Busch. Already, President Busch has begun dismantling the old Junta and begun constructing a new one.\n\nFor the last year, President Toro has been the head of the Military Socialist Junta, a government meant to reconcile the radical elements of the left and the reactionary magnates of the country. Although achieving some early success, for the most part, the junta has been unsuccessful in its attempts to enact reform and begin Bolivia's economic recovery from the Great Depression and The Chaco War, preferring to take the safe, pragmatic options instead of the decisive action that is necessary to heal the ailments of the nation. \n\nPresident Busch has promised to take the bold steps initially promised by the revolution, and bring prosperity back to Bolivia. With the support of both the left and the right, Busch has already in fact, begun to pass much-needed social reforms, a sign of good things to come.\n\nHowever, Toro and his allies are still influential, and only time will tell if this latest government will stand, or collapse like the others before it."

 BOL_Politics.3.t: "Germán Busch Dead!"
 BOL_Politics.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Tragedy has struck the country today in La Paz, as President Germán Busch was found shot in his office early this morning. Quickly rushed to the hospital, doctors frantically worked to save the President's life. Unfortunately, their efforts were for naught, as President Busch passed away in the early hours of the morning. \n\nEarly police investigations are finding that President Busch had taken his own life. Although this theory is supported by forensic evidence and the well known depressive mindset of the President, many rumours have sprung up suspecting foul play on the part of members of his Junta. For now, however, the nation is in mourning. as the hero of the military's socialist revolution and The Chaco War has passed, leaving them without a leader."
